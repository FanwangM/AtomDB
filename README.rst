About
-----

AtomDB is a database of atomic and ionic properties.

Installation
------------

.. code-block::

    python -m pip install -e .

Usage
-----

.. code-block::

    % python -m atomdb -h
    usage: python -m atomdb [-h] [-c] [-q] [--exc EXC] dataset elem basis charge mult

    Compile and/or query an AtomDB entry

    positional arguments:
    dataset     Dataset
    elem        Element symbol
    basis       Basis set
    charge      Charge
    mult        Multiplicity

    optional arguments:
    -h, --help  show this help message and exit
    -c          Compile the specified entry
    -q          Query the specified entry
    --exc EXC   Excitation level

If AtomDB is installed in a directory for which you do not have write permissions, or if you'd
rather store your AtomDB database in another directory (or you already have one), then you
can set the ``ATOMDB_DATAPATH`` environment variable to the directory of your choice; either
a non-existing directory, or an existing AtomDB database.

On release, AtomDB should come with compiled database files pre-installed in the default
``ATOMDB_DATAPATH``. Raw data files containing the output of electronic structure computations
will be hosted in another Git repo (AtomDB-Data) via LFS. If you are a developer working on compiling new
database entries or writing new datasets, then you can set ``ATOMDB_DATAPATH`` to the location
of the AtomDB-Data repo on your computer.

Send Michael your SSH public key and ask him for the current URL for the AtomDB-Data repo.

Contributing

You can help by writing features, properties, and datasets, or by running computations! üôÇ

TODO
~~~~
- Add functions for dealing with multiple database entries at once
- Add more properties (C-DFT, SP-CDFT, etc.)
- Add more datasets (Hartree-Fock, some useful DFT calcs...?)
- Get the NIST dataset, and add those dataset-independent fields to the DB entries
- Make all field names consistent with IOData
- See Issues tab
